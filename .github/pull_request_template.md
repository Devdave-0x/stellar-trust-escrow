## Tests

<!--
List the exact commands you ran. If no tests were added, explain why.

cargo test -p stellar-trust-escrow-contract

# Backend
npm run test -w backend

# Frontend
npm run test:unit -w frontend

# Lint
npm run lint:all
```

**New or updated tests:** <!-- yes / no — if yes, name the file(s) -->

<!-- If no documentation needed updating, state why. -->

- [ ] Docs updated (list files below)

## CHANGELOG

## Review notes

<!--
Anything reviewers should know:

- follow-up issues filed or planned
- deployment, migration, or rollback considerations

## Migration safety checklist

<!-- Complete this section if this PR includes database migrations. Delete if not applicable. -->

- [ ] **Dry-run verified** — `node database/migrations/migrate.js up --dry-run` was run and SQL reviewed
- [ ] **Rollback exists** — every new migration file exports a `down()` function
- [ ] **Rollback tested** — `node database/migrations/migrate.js down` was executed in staging and succeeded
- [ ] **Two-phase approach** — destructive operations (column removal, table drops) use a deprecate-first strategy; the removal ships in a subsequent deploy
- [ ] **Index strategy** — new indexes are created `CONCURRENTLY` where possible to avoid table locks
- [ ] No migration is included — reason: <!-- fill in -->
