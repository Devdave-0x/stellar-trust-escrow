Recommended install commands:

```bash
rustup toolchain install stable
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install --locked --force soroban-cli
```

## Soroban Development Environment

This section covers everything specific to the Rust/Soroban layer. Skip it if you are only working on the frontend or backend.

### Rust toolchain and Soroban CLI

```bash
# Install stable Rust (1.74+ required)
rustup toolchain install stable
rustup default stable

# Add the WASM compilation target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Install the Soroban CLI (pin to a known-good version)
cargo install --locked soroban-cli --version 21.0.0
```

Verify:

```bash
rustc --version        # rustc 1.74.0 or later
soroban --version      # soroban 21.x.x
```

### Configure a Stellar testnet identity

```bash
# Generate a new keypair and fund it from Friendbot
soroban keys generate --global contributor --network testnet
soroban keys fund contributor --network testnet
```

### Workspace structure

The Cargo workspace (`Cargo.toml` at the repository root) contains four contract crates:

| Crate                              | Path                           | Purpose                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `stellar-trust-escrow-contract`    | `contracts/escrow_contract`    | Core milestone escrow logic    |
| `stellar-trust-governance`         | `contracts/governance`         | On-chain governance and voting |
| `stellar-trust-insurance-contract` | `contracts/insurance_contract` | Dispute insurance pool         |
| `stellar-trust-escrow-extensions`  | `contracts/escrow_extensions`  | Optional escrow add-ons        |

All four share a single `[profile.release]` in the root `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level        = "z"
overflow-checks  = true   # integer overflow panics instead of wrapping — critical for financial logic
debug            = 0
strip            = "symbols"
debug-assertions = false
panic            = "abort"
codegen-units    = 1
lto              = true
```

`overflow-checks = true` is intentional. Any arithmetic that would silently wrap in a standard release build will instead abort the contract, preventing fund-accounting bugs. Do not disable it.

### Running contract tests

Run tests for a single crate to keep feedback fast:

```bash
# Core escrow contract
cargo test -p stellar-trust-escrow-contract

# Governance contract
cargo test -p stellar-trust-governance

# Escrow extensions
cargo test -p stellar-trust-escrow-extensions

# All crates at once
cargo test --workspace
```

Run a specific test by name:

```bash
cargo test -p stellar-trust-escrow-contract test_approve_milestone_o1_completion_check
```

### Soroban test harness patterns

Soroban tests use an in-process mock environment rather than a live network. The patterns below appear throughout the test suite.

**`Env::default()`** — creates an isolated in-memory Soroban environment:

```rust
let env = Env::default();
```

**`mock_all_auths()`** — bypasses `require_auth()` checks so tests can call any function without real signatures:

```rust
env.mock_all_auths();
```

Call this once at the top of a test. Remove it if you are specifically testing authorisation failures.

**`Address::generate(&env)`** — generates a deterministic test address:

```rust
let client     = Address::generate(&env);
let freelancer = Address::generate(&env);
```

**`env.ledger().with_mut()`** — advances the ledger clock to simulate time passing:

```rust
// Jump forward 7 days
env.ledger().with_mut(|l| {
    l.timestamp += 7 * 24 * 60 * 60;
});
```

Use this to test deadline expiry, timelock release, and recurring payment scheduling.

A minimal test skeleton:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_example() {
    let env = Env::default();
    env.mock_all_auths();

    let client     = Address::generate(&env);
    let freelancer = Address::generate(&env);
    // ... register contract, call functions, assert state
}
```

## 15-Minute Quickstart

This path assumes Node, Rust, Docker, and Git are already installed.

### 1. Fork and clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stellar-trust-escrow.git
cd stellar-trust-escrow
git remote add upstream https://github.com/barry01-hash/stellar-trust-escrow.git
```

### 2. Install workspace dependencies

```bash
npm ci
```

### 3. Start Postgres

Use Docker for the database even if you run the app locally:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
```

### 4. Configure local environment files

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
```

PowerShell equivalent:

```powershell
Copy-Item backend/.env.example backend/.env
Copy-Item frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
```

Update these values in `backend/.env` for local development:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/stellar_escrow
DIRECT_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/stellar_escrow
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

`frontend/.env.local` usually only needs:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

### 5. Prepare the database

```bash
npm run db:generate -w backend
npm run db:migrate -w backend
```

### 6. Start backend and frontend

Run these in separate terminals:

```bash
npm run dev -w backend
```

```bash
npm run dev -w frontend
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

### 7. Optional: build the contracts locally

```bash
cargo build -p stellar-trust-escrow-contract --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo build -p stellar-trust-insurance-contract --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## Development Workflow

### Branch naming

Branches must follow this pattern (enforced by the pre-push hook):

```
<type>/<short-description>
```

| Prefix      | When to use                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `feat/`     | New functionality                             |
| `fix/`      | Bug fix                                       |
| `refactor/` | Code improvement, no behaviour change         |
| `docs/`     | Documentation only                            |
| `test/`     | Tests only                                    |
| `chore/`    | Tooling, dependencies, config                 |
| `hotfix/`   | Urgent production fix branched from `main`    |
| `release/`  | Release preparation (version bump, CHANGELOG) |

Examples:

```
feat/wallet-retry-logic
fix/backend-health-route
docs/contributor-onboarding
chore/upgrade-prisma-5
```

Keep the description short, lowercase, and hyphen-separated. No ticket numbers in the branch name — link the issue in the PR instead.

---

### Commit message format — Conventional Commits

Every commit must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

<optional body — explain WHY if the diff doesn't make it obvious>

<optional footer>
BREAKING CHANGE: <description>
Closes #<issue>
```

**Type must be one of:**

| Type       | When to use                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `feat`     | New feature visible to users or callers    |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                    |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                    |
| `security` | Security fix or hardening                  |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring, no behaviour change    |
| `test`     | Adding or fixing tests                     |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                         |
| `chore`    | Build process, tooling, dependency updates |

**Scope** is optional but encouraged — use the layer or domain (`backend`, `contracts`, `frontend`, `mobile`, `webhooks`, `auth`, etc.).

**Subject line rules:**

- Imperative mood: "add pagination" not "adds pagination" or "added pagination"
- No capital first letter
- No trailing period
- 72 characters max

**Examples:**

```
feat(backend): add cursor pagination to /api/escrows
fix(contracts): prevent integer overflow in milestone release
docs: expand PR lifecycle section in CONTRIBUTING
chore(deps): upgrade @stellar/stellar-sdk to 12.1.0
test(backend): add dispute resolution edge cases
```

If a commit introduces a breaking change, add a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer:

```
feat(api)!: rename client_address to clientAddress in all responses

BREAKING CHANGE: all API consumers must update field references.
Closes #200
```

The `!` after the type is shorthand — the footer is still required.

---

### Typical flow

```bash
# 1. Branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop
git checkout -b feat/my-feature

# 2. Make changes, then run the relevant checks
#    (see Testing All Layers and Code Style sections below)

# 3. Commit
git add <files>
git commit -m "feat(backend): add my feature"

# 4. Push
git push -u origin feat/my-feature
```

Open the pull request on GitHub, targeting `develop`. Use the PR template — filling it in completely is a requirement, not a suggestion.

## Testing All Layers

Run the checks that match the layer you touched. If your PR crosses multiple layers, run all of them.

### Smart contracts

Run the full workspace:

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

Run a single crate for faster iteration:

```bash
cargo test -p stellar-trust-escrow-contract
cargo test -p stellar-trust-governance
cargo test -p stellar-trust-escrow-extensions
cargo test -p stellar-trust-insurance-contract
```

Run a specific test by name:

```bash
cargo test -p stellar-trust-escrow-contract <test_name>
```

For deeper contract verification on macOS, Linux, or WSL:

```bash
bash scripts/test-contract.sh --gas --coverage
```

### End-to-end simulation scripts

`scripts/simulate/` contains self-contained shell scripts that deploy the escrow contract to Soroban testnet and walk through real lifecycle scenarios. Use them to verify behaviour end-to-end or to demonstrate the contract to integrators.

| Script                   | Scenario                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `happy-path.sh`          | Create escrow → add milestones → freelancer submits → client approves → funds released |
| `dispute-resolution.sh`  | Escrow disputed by client → arbiter rules entirely in client's favour → full refund    |
| `expiry-refund.sh`       | Escrow with a short deadline → freelancer misses it → `expire_escrow` refunds client   |
| `mutual-cancellation.sh` | Client requests cancellation → freelancer consents → immediate settlement              |

**Prerequisites:**

```bash
# Install the Stellar CLI (includes Soroban support)
cargo install --locked stellar-cli
# or, for older installs:
cargo install --locked soroban-cli --version 21.0.0
```

**Running a simulation:**

Each script is self-contained — it generates fresh key-pairs, funds them from Friendbot, builds the WASM, and deploys the contract from scratch. No existing credentials or `.env` file needed.

```bash
# Make scripts executable (first time only)
chmod +x scripts/simulate/*.sh

# Full happy-path lifecycle
bash scripts/simulate/happy-path.sh

# Arbiter dispute resolution
bash scripts/simulate/dispute-resolution.sh

# Expiry with automatic refund (waits ~60 s for deadline to pass)
bash scripts/simulate/expiry-refund.sh

# Mutual cancellation by both parties
bash scripts/simulate/mutual-cancellation.sh
```

Each script prints a numbered step log and a summary table showing contract ID, escrow ID, outcome, and a Stellar Expert link for on-chain inspection. Expected runtime: under 2 minutes per script.

**Network configuration:**

By default, all scripts target Soroban testnet. Override with environment variables:

```bash
SOROBAN_NETWORK=testnet \
SOROBAN_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org \
SOROBAN_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE="Test SDF Network ; September 2015" \
bash scripts/simulate/happy-path.sh
```

PRs that touch contract logic must include at least one new test. Use `Env::default()` and `mock_all_auths()` (see [Soroban test harness patterns](#soroban-test-harness-patterns) above). Time-sensitive behaviour must be covered with `env.ledger().with_mut()`.

### Backend

```bash
npm run test -w backend
```

Database-related backend changes should also include:

```bash
npm run db:migrate:status -w backend
```

### Frontend

```bash
npm run test:unit -w frontend
npm run test:integration -w frontend
npm run test:a11y -w frontend
```

Install Playwright browsers once before the first end-to-end run:

```bash
cd frontend
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium firefox
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run test:e2e -w frontend
```

### Helpful root shortcuts

```bash
npm run test
npm run test:all
```

`npm run test` covers frontend and backend. `npm run test:all` adds the Rust workspace tests and a frontend production build.

## Code Style and Linting

### JavaScript and TypeScript

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

### Rust contracts

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

### All lint checks

```bash
npm run lint:all
```

Notes:

- ESLint and Prettier cover the JS and TS codebase.
- Husky is installed, but you should still run the relevant checks yourself before pushing.
- Keep PRs focused. If you touch contracts and frontend together, explain why in the PR.

## Pull Request Process

### Before you open a PR

- Claim or create an issue first. Leave a comment so no one duplicates your work.
- Keep the branch scoped to **one logical change**. If you find an unrelated bug while working, fix it in a separate branch.
- Run all relevant checks for the layer(s) you touched (see [Testing All Layers](#testing-all-layers) and [Code Style and Linting](#code-style-and-linting)).
- Update documentation when behaviour changes. If you add an endpoint, update `docs/api/`. If you change an env variable, update README and `.env.example`.

### PR lifecycle

```
Draft  →  Ready for Review  →  Approved  →  Merged
```

**Draft** — open as a draft as soon as the branch exists if you want early visibility or async feedback before the work is done. Drafts do not trigger maintainer review.

**Ready for Review** — convert to "Ready for review" only when:

- All checklist items in the PR template are ticked
- CI is green (or you have explained a known transient failure)
- You have resolved or replied to every comment from the draft phase

**Approved** — at least one maintainer must approve. For changes to contract logic, two approvals are required. Approval does not mean merge — it means the reviewer is satisfied. The author does the merge after approval.

**Merged** — always merge into `develop`, never directly into `main`. Use the **"Squash and merge"** strategy for feature and fix branches so the commit history on `develop` stays clean and follows Conventional Commits. Use **"Merge commit"** for `release/` branches so the merge point is visible.

### Target branch

| Branch type                                              | Target                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `docs/`, `test/`, `chore/` | `develop`                                 |
| `release/vX.Y.Z`                                         | `main`                                    |
| `hotfix/`                                                | `main` **and** back-merged into `develop` |

Never open a PR directly against `main` unless it is a release or hotfix.

### What every PR must include

| Requirement            | Details                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Passing CI**         | All checks must be green. Do not ask for review with a red pipeline.                                                              |
| **Tests**              | New features need tests. Bug fixes need a regression test. Refactors with no behaviour change are exempt — state this explicitly. |
| **Documentation**      | Update any affected doc, README section, or `.env.example`. Link the relevant file in the PR body.                                |
| **CHANGELOG entry**    | Add a line under `## [Unreleased]` for any user- or caller-visible change. See [Versioning Policy](#versioning-policy).           |
| **Linked issue**       | `Closes #<number>` in the PR body.                                                                                                |
| **Filled-in template** | Every section of the PR template must be completed — do not delete sections and leave them blank.                                 |

### Addressing review feedback

- Push follow-up commits to the same branch — do not close and reopen the PR.
- Resolve a comment thread only after the requested change is made; let the reviewer re-check.
- If you disagree with feedback, reply with reasoning. Maintainers can be wrong.
- Mark trivial acknowledgements ("good catch, fixed") with a thumbs-up rather than a new comment to keep the thread readable.

### Review expectations by change type

| Change type        | Expectation                                                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Documentation only | Commands must be tested locally; no broken links                                  |
| Backend / API      | Tests covering the new or changed behaviour; migration status verified            |
| Contract logic     | Two approvals; new Soroban test using `Env::default()` + `mock_all_auths()`       |
| Frontend / UI      | Screenshots or short screen recording included                                    |
| Breaking change    | Clearly labelled in the PR title (`!` suffix on type) and body; CHANGELOG updated |

## Finding a First Issue

Use GitHub labels to find a good starting point:

| Label              | What it usually means                                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `good-first-issue` | Beginner-friendly tasks with a clear path to completion  |
| `documentation`    | Docs cleanups, onboarding, examples, and guides          |
| `frontend`         | Next.js UI, accessibility, and interaction work          |
| `backend`          | API, services, Prisma, and operational tooling           |
| `smart-contract`   | Rust and Soroban work                                    |
| `testing`          | Unit, integration, accessibility, or end-to-end coverage |

Useful searches:

If you want an issue, leave a comment so maintainers know it is in progress.

## OS Notes

- Linux and macOS: native setup is straightforward.
- Windows: use PowerShell for npm and Docker commands. Install Visual Studio Build Tools for native Rust builds, or use WSL if you want Linux-style contract tooling and bash-based helper scripts like `scripts/test-contract.sh`.
- Docker Desktop works well for local Postgres on all three platforms.

## Troubleshooting

### `npm ci` fails early

Make sure you are on Node 18+ and rerun from the repository root.

### Prisma cannot connect

Confirm Docker Postgres is running:

```bash
docker compose ps postgres
```

Then verify `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL` both point at the same local instance unless you intentionally use separate pooled and direct connections.

### Rust contract builds fail on Windows

Install Visual Studio Build Tools with the C++ workload, or run the Rust contract commands inside WSL.

### Frontend cannot reach the backend

Check that:

- backend is running on port `4000`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000`
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` includes `http://localhost:3000`

### Playwright tests fail before opening a browser

Install browsers first:

## Versioning Policy

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).

### What triggers each version component

| Component | When to increment                                                    | Examples                                                                                    |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MAJOR     | Breaking change — existing integrations must change to upgrade       | Renamed API field, removed endpoint, contract storage migration, changed JWT format         |
| MINOR     | New backward-compatible feature                                      | New endpoint, new optional field, new contract function that doesn't break existing callers |
| PATCH     | Bug fix or internal improvement that doesn't change the API contract | Fixed off-by-one in pagination, improved error message, dependency security patch           |

A **breaking change** is any change that requires callers to update their code or data to continue working. When in doubt, treat it as breaking.

### CHANGELOG maintenance

- The CHANGELOG is updated **manually** as part of every PR that changes behaviour.
- Every entry goes under `## [Unreleased]` until a release is cut.
- Follow the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format: subsections are `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security`.
- Include the PR or issue number in parentheses: `- Added foo bar (#123)`.
- Do **not** auto-generate the CHANGELOG from commit messages — the audience is integrators, not Git history readers.

### Release process

1. Create a `release/vX.Y.Z` branch from `develop`.
2. Move all entries from `## [Unreleased]` to a new `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section in `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Update the comparison link at the bottom of `CHANGELOG.md`.
4. Open a PR targeting `main`. Title: `release: vX.Y.Z`.
5. After merge, create a Git tag: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"` and push it.
6. Publish a GitHub Release using the CHANGELOG section as the body.
7. The `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow validates that the CHANGELOG contains an entry for the tag being released.
